🕸️ Website Scraper & Business Brochure Generator
This project is an automation tool that scrapes the entire content of a given website and generates a professional business brochure based on the extracted information. It’s designed to help businesses, marketers, and developers quickly convert a web presence into a well-structured, offline-ready brochure.
